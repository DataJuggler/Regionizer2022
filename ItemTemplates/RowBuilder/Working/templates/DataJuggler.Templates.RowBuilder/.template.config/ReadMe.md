DataJuggler.Templates.RowBuilder

This Item Template creates a RowBuilder class used to generate rows for a DataJuggler.Blazor.Components.Grid, 
targeting data sources created with DataTier.NET and typically installed via the Regionizer 2022 VS extension.

Status: Experimental

This template supports upcoming features and depends on new functionality in DataTier.NET, including:

Code-generation of a GetValue(string fieldName) accessor on your data objects (handled by DataTier.NET).

Regioniser2022 has a GUI being developed to install DataJuggler.Blazor.Component razor files as well as
create RowBuilder for use with the Grid. 

DataJuggler.Blazor.Components is being updated with methods in GridHelper to simply this process.

As these features land, this template will be updated accordingly.
